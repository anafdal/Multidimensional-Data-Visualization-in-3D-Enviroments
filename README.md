# Purpose
The amount of data in our world is increasing quickly. As data keeps increasing, so will its number of dimensions so it will become necessary for multi-dimensional data to be represented in an environment where all of its dimensions can be fully defined in order to be interpreted correctly, specifically by audiences with no background in data analysis. Therefore, immersive 3D environments like Immersive Analytics simulations, which include both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, provide a great opportunity to its users as they have the advantage of including higher dimensions of data and providing a perspective from different angles which is not always possible in the traditional 2D interpretations. However, the problem is that there is minimal to no guidelines about using higher dimensions of data in a 3D environment through visual means, which is what this research is interested in contributing by investigating how the user observes the data in different dimensions through different applications. The purpose of this research project is to understand how introducing multidimensional data in a 3D environment like Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and a 3D Desktop application, can affect the interpretation of the data by the subjects. Specifically to gain a better understanding of how using immersive 3D environments for Data Visualization can affect the judgment of the subjects by introducing them to various dimensions with real-world data. The research questions are:

1. When presented with different levels of the data dimensions, how will this affect the user’s decoding of the data in Immersive Analytics?

2. How will each 3D setting affect the user’s observation of a particular multi-dimensional data?
